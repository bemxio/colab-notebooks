Made this back in August 17th 2020, when deepfake memes were at its peak. It's basically the old demo from [`first-order-motion-model`](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/blob/master/old_demo.ipynb), with an additional cell for adding the template audio to the final video.

The [tutorial](tutorial.txt) file was made back in 2020 as well, so it might link to unavailable Google Drive files. In case of that, search the [original repository](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model) for the files.
