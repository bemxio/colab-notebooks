1. Resize the face picture to be 256 x 256 pixels.
2. Make a folder called "first-order-motion-model" on your Google Drive.
3. Put the face picture and the template video in that folder.
    3.1. Rename the face picture to "02.png"
    3.2. Rename the template video to "04.mp4"
4. Make a copy of every .tar file from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kZ1gCnpfU0BnpdU47pLM_TQ6RypDDqgw?usp=sharing
    4.1. Move the files to "first-order-motion-model" on your drive.
    4.2. Delete the "Copy" from the file name of both files.
5. Go to the Google Colab link (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hZ0LEJ4ZO42ebdfvEIZ7cGf4S7Fkk4NR).
6. Run each checkpoint (by clicking the square on the left top side of the code) one after another.
7. Click the folder icon on the left site of a page.
8. Click the 3 dots on the "result.mp4" file and press "Download".

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
If you ended making it or you want to make another one, 
click the arrow on the RAM and disk statistics,
click "Manage sessions",
and click the trash icon/"Terminate" button.

And here you go! You've made the deepfake meme :D
Of course this algorithm isn't perfect,
so sometimes it would not lip sync,
and it would overall look weird.

FAQ:
Q: I get "Cannot connect to GPU" pop-up!
A: Colab has a limit of GPU usage, 
   so it can share GPU power to the others.
   Wait around 12 - 24 hours,
   or just make an another account for it.
Q: I get a red circle when I'm trying to run the checkpoint!
A: You probably made a typo somewhere.
   Make sure your:
   • folder name is "first-order-motion-model"
   • face picture name is "02.png"
   • template picture name is "04.mp4"
   And check if you copied .tar files into the folder and deleted "Copy" off their names.
